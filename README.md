This is a software project for a Software Engineering class at the [Federal University of Campina Grande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Campina_Grande "Federal University of Campina Grande") | 2015.2

The class is lectured by the Professor [Rohit Gheyi](https://br.linkedin.com/in/rohit-gheyi-75850361 "Rohit Gheyi's linkedIn profile")
and aims at applying the core concepts of software engineering to *real world* applications. Testing the software, planning ahead, 
planning development and so on. 

####What **this** project tries to do.
 * This project tries to provide a platform where many restaurants can be managed with more easiness. 
 * Each owner can register his own restaurant, employees, products, special offers and so on. 
 * Provide an API where a user can search which place, is the best for him/her.
 * Provide a functionality where users that are inside a restaurant can make orders. Therefore, diminishing the average service time to the customer and increasing his satisfaction.<sup>[1](#note1)</sup>
 
 Note that this system could be potentially evolved to integrate, strong [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRM) concepts. Make it more sociable
 so users could invite friends, see events, and so on.
